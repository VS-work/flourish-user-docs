Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\n We use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you\u0026rsquo;re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you\u0026rsquo;re not yet ready for a review, add \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; to the PR name to indicate it\u0026rsquo;s a work in progress. (Don\u0026rsquo;t add the Hugo property \u0026ldquo;draft = true\u0026rdquo; to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it\u0026rsquo;s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of \u0026ldquo;Deploy preview ready\u0026rdquo; to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you\u0026rsquo;re happy with the content. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; markers.  Updating a single page If you\u0026rsquo;ve just spotted something you\u0026rsquo;d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You\u0026rsquo;ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS. Fork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git  Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you\u0026rsquo;re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you\u0026rsquo;ve found a problem in the docs, but you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources  Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

In addition, this article showshow the most commonly used Tables and Schemas are arranged and describe their structure in detail.\nDatabase levels concept Flourish has three types of Databases: Company Level, Facility Level, and Common\nExample: Client has 1 Cultivation Center and 2 Stores, in Flourish terminology, that means that client has 3 Facilities. Each facility has its own database, resulting in 3 Facility Level databases in total. However, there is a 4-th Company Level database. Company DB contains data thats spans across facilities, i.e items,strains, customers, etc.\nCommon database contains only static data that is shared between Facility and Company databases. It is used, for instance, to perform [Purchase Limits validation]()\nEvery Facility Level database has VIEWS to reference every table at the Company Level.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say that we have the following:\nCompanyDB: ABC CultivationFacility: DEF StoreFacility: GHI StoreFacility: JKL The item table is defined in CompanyDB ABC, however, we have an item VIEW for DEF, GHI, JKL, which points to ABC.item, which means that following queries all return same data:\nSELECT * from ABC.item; SELECT * from DEF.item; SELECT * from GHI.item; SELECT * from JKL.item; For development purposes use the following databases:\nCompany: 58b9ae9c280e20ea24a126b8\nFacility: 58b9b09d280e20ea24a126bb\nFacility level Grow module tables  plant: one row per plant group_hdr: one row per group group_strain_dtl: one row per group / per strain metrc_plant_batch metrc_plant_batch_dtl harvest_hdr: one row per harvest harvest_strain_dtl: one row per harvest / per strain harvest_dtl: one row per weight entry (can be plant specific) group_harvest: relationship between group_hdr and harvest_hdr  Group Things to remember:\n A group is a grouping of plants that is tracked together; A group can only be in a single location/status at one time; Groups can contain multiple strains;  Tables  group_hdr group_strain_dtl plant  Table Relationships group_hdr (gh) -\u0026gt; plant (p) gh.group_hdr_pk = p.group_hdr_pk* group_hdr (gh) -\u0026gt; group_strain_dtl (gsd) gh.group_hdr_pk = gsd.group_hdr_pk group_strain_dtl (gsd) -\u0026gt; plant (p) gsd.group_hdr_pk = p.group_hdr_pk AND gsd.strain_id = p.strain_id group_strain_dtl.group_hdr_pk Plant batches To accommodate METRC requirements, Flourish team has designed the concept of \u0026ldquo;plant batches\u0026rdquo;, which represent subset of plants that were created at one period of time.\nExample: Anytime someone goes through the process of creating plants Grow -\u0026gt; Clone -\u0026gt; Create Plants, a new plant batch is created.\nThings to know:\n No changes will ever be required to the plant batches design idea; Created batches are stored in the metrc_plant_batch table. Once a plant is associated with a plant batch, its association cannot be changed. Plants can move around and group can be split or combined, so we keep a record of which plant batches belong to which groups using the metrc_plant_batch_group tables.  Tables  metrc_plant_batch metrc_plant_batch_group  Table Relationships plant (p) -\u0026gt; metrc_plant_batch (mpb) p.metrc_plant_batch_id = mpb.metrc_plant_batch_id metrc_plant_batch (mpb) -\u0026gt; metrc_plant_batch_group mpb.metrc_plant_batch_id = mpbg.metrc_plant_batch_id group_hdr (gh) -\u0026gt; metrc_plant_batch_group (mpb) gh.group_hdr_pk = mpbg.group_hdr_pk Harvest Harvests are similar to groups, they represent the same thing: a grouping of plants, the only difference is that they were all harvested together. Once a group is ready, it is then harvested\nNote: Harvests are a different entity than groups.\nThings to know:\n A harvest can contain multiple groups A harvest can contain multiple strains Weights are recorded on harvests and then packages can be created from these weights  Tables  harvest_hdr harvest_strain_dtl harvest_dtl group_harvest  Company Level [TBA]\n","excerpt":"This article explains Flourish database structure, database relations, and gives an idea of how to …","ref":"https://vs-work.github.io/flourish-user-docs/docs/database/","title":"Database Overview"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\n This section is where the user documentation for your project lives - all the information your users need to understand and successfully use your project.\nFor large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them don’t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own.

In Flourish, customer is considered underage if he is younger than 21. For Customers under the age of 18 with a qualifying medical condition, obtaining a medical card requires two physician recommendations and a parent/guardian approval.\nMMID A medical cannabis card (MMID) or medical marijuana (MMJ) card is a state issued identification card that enables a patient with a doctor\u0026rsquo;s recommendation to obtain, possess, or cultivate cannabis for medicinal use despite marijuana\u0026rsquo;s lack of the normal Food and Drug Administration testing for safety and efficacy.\nCustomer Eligibility Flourish has two 2 customer verification statuses - Verified / Not verified. Verified can be of 2 types - Medical \u0026amp; Recreational. Not Verified can be of 3 types - Recreational, Underage, Not Verified.\nNote: It is important where the customer\u0026rsquo;s Medical Card is issued, as it depends on whether he/she can buy cannabis goods or not. This can be seen in the \u0026ldquo;Medical Card is issued in the facility\u0026rsquo;s state\u0026rdquo; column in the table below. To get a clear understanding of state regulations\nCustomer status can be viewed or changed inside the POS application in his or her profile, as seen on the image\nSource code reference POS:\nAll customer verification is checked using the getCustomerVerification function in auth.service.ts\nWEB:\nAll customer verification is checked using getCustomerVerification function inside customer-auth.service service\nDatabase level reference Customer status is stored in the Company Level database, inside customer table there is the is_verified column.\nPOS Authentication Token Life Cycle Authentication is a part of customer validation. In this part of an article, we will delve into the differences between WEB and POS modules authentication pipeline and, token lifecycle.\nLog in:\nPOS module authentication system has two tokens - terminal_token and token. When customer logs in using email+password combination, we set both terminal_token and token to the same value, and after that, if PIN login is used, we leave the terminal_token alone but replace the token with the new one for the PIN\u0026rsquo;ned-in user.\nLog out:\nWhen customer decides to log out, the auth logout function checks both terminal_token and token tokens, and if they are\n Different: customer is then redirected to PIN-request page and token becomes equal to the terminal_token;\n Same: then both terminal_token and token are deleted and customer log all the way out to the email login screen.\n  ","excerpt":"Marijuana Customer Status Validation This article will walk through the identity verification …","ref":"https://vs-work.github.io/flourish-user-docs/docs/customer-validation/","title":"Validation Rules"},{"body":" This is a typical blog post that includes images.\nThe front matter specifies the date of the blog post, its title, a short description that will be displayed on the blog landing page, and its author.\nIncluding images Here\u0026rsquo;s an image (featured-sunset-get.png) that includes a byline and a caption.\nFetch and scale an image in the upcoming Hugo 0.43.

Recreational \u0026amp; Medical states all have something in common – they sell weed and each have limits too, restrictions on how much customers can buy on any given day or at any given time, to make sure Flourish legally selling them the amount mandated by law.\nGlossary Purchase Limit are the limits that are established by law for the purchase of goods with the content of cannabis.\nValidation Process Overview There are limits of 2 types, Medical and Recreational. Depending on the status of the custom, such a limit will be applied.\nFacility has limits that are set by state law, so when customer makes a purchase and before he sends it for payment, purchase has to be validated, or otherwise all buttons are going to be hidden.\nWhen customer adds the product to the basket, the \u0026ldquo;Validate\u0026rdquo; button appears. Selecting \u0026ldquo;Validate\u0026rdquo; button sends and API call to compare the amount of cannabis that customer have already bought in the last 24 hours and planning to buy in current purchase.\nIf customer exceeded the limits, then he or she will see an error message, stating that there are too many substances than are allowed.\n![]()\nIf everything is ok, success message and the remaining buttons for working with the order appear.\n![]()\nNote: For Nevada, validation is a little different right now (November, 2019). During validation, the product that was purchased by the customer in the last 24 hours is not added to the quantity of goods in the basket, that is, validation occurs only within the order.\nLimits are set for a certain category of goods.

This article provides details on the process of each of those transactions.\nGlossary Here are some quick definitions of relevant terms:\n Product Return: is the process of a customer taking previously purchased merchandise back to the retailer, and in turn exchanging for another item (identical or different) or receiving a refund in cash, or a account credit.\n Account credit refunds: Customer may request a full or partial refund of a sale, resulting in the client account balance, that he can spend on future purchases.\n Cash refunds: Customer may request a full or partial refund of a sale in cash, this method helps to increase customer satisfaction.\n Manual Payments: Payments that supposed to be transacted with a third-party transaction (LINX or CanPay), but for one reason or another, they weren\u0026rsquo;t able to be processed in Flourish. The transaction still needs to be recorded in Flourish, and this is possible via Manual Payment\n  Things to know  Returns must be done at the same dispensary that made the initial sale. The PackageLabel needs to be the same as the original sale to maintain compliant traceability records The PatientLicenseNumber and/or CaregiverNumber that was recorded on the original receipt should be on the new return receipt. This is critical in states where recurring purchase allotments are programmatically governed; Returns can be processed even if the original sale has been finalized. Returns can be processed even if the original package has been consumed.  Refund options Refunds There are two methods to make a refund - cash and account credit.\nThe manager has the ability to choose cash as the refund method instead of the default method, account credit. This functionality allows issuing cash refunds to customers in cases where an account credit refund isn\u0026rsquo;t acceptable.\nThe refund method will always default to \u0026ldquo;Account Credit.\u0026rdquo; Changing the refund method to \u0026ldquo;Cash\u0026rdquo; will require a manager pin approval every time.

Since the transaction is pending and has not cleared the customer\u0026rsquo;s account, it means the sale can be prevented from going through.\nGlossary  Void transaction: Transaction that is canceled by a merchant or vendor before it settles through a consumer\u0026rsquo;s debit or credit card account. It may appear as a pending transaction when the customer checks their account online.  Understanding void transactions When a transaction takes place, the merchant swipes the customer\u0026rsquo;s debit or credit card. If there are enough funds in the customer\u0026rsquo;s account, the terminal authorizes the transaction. But the transaction is not fully settled, as payment has to be released from the customer\u0026rsquo;s account to the merchant.\nIf there is a problem with the transaction, it can be voided—even though it hasn\u0026rsquo;t settled. Since the transaction is pending and has not cleared the customer\u0026rsquo;s account, it means the sale can be prevented from going through.\nIn order to void the transaction, the customer must contact the merchant and request the transaction be reversed. Once it is voided, the transaction will show up on the customer\u0026rsquo;s account as a pending transaction, which disappears after a certain amount of time.\nThe hold can last anywhere from 24 hours to several days, causing the customer an inconvenience because he or she won’t be able to access the money during that time.\nA void transaction takes place on the same day as the original transaction.\nVoiding transactions The manager can void cash and manual payment transactions in POS on the same day they occur. This allows for correcting human errors when a cash payment, manual LINX, or manual CanPay payment is recorded incorrectly.\nTransaction history On purchases that have transactions, there is a \u0026ldquo;Transactions History\u0026rdquo; button inside of POS. When this button is selected, a modal will open showing a transaction history table that is similar to the transaction history table on the web. Next to \u0026ldquo;Cash\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Manual Payments\u0026rdquo;, there is a \u0026ldquo;Void\u0026rdquo; button/link. The void button/link appears only on \u0026ldquo;Cash\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Manual Payment\u0026rdquo; transactions, on transactions that occurred today, on transactions that occurred at the same facility the user is currently authenticated, and for transactions that hasn’t been voided already. When the void link is selected the void transaction modal will be shown.\nWhen the void link on the POS transaction history modal is selected, the user will see this void transaction modal. A manager (permission based) reviews the transaction details, will enter their pin, and will select \u0026ldquo;Submit\u0026rdquo; button, to void the transaction. After submitting, the screen gos to the \u0026ldquo;create payment\u0026rdquo; screen with the balance due reflecting the recently voided transactions.\nAPI Calls GET go_api/grow/report/transactions - gets all transactions which were made during the purchase; POST go_api/retail/payments/${transactionId}/void - void a particular transaction;\nValidation  The void functionality is available only for the transaction, which:  Has \u0026ldquo;Cash\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Manual Payment\u0026rdquo; payment method; Transactions older than one day can\u0026rsquo;t be voided; Occur at the same facility the customer is currently authenticated; Hasn\u0026rsquo;t been voided already; If there is no returned item in the purchase; Facility ID returned from processRequest transaction should be the same as the facility ID on the original order payment transaction record If there is at least one refund transaction in the order, voiding transactions in this order becomes impossible.
